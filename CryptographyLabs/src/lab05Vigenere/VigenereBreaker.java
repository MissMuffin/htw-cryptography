	 * Look for repeated bits. The distance between the two is probably a multiple of the key length.
	 * If you can find a number of these - the longer the better - and have a number of distances,
	 * you might use a gcd to find the length :) Or you can use the Friedman test and calculate the coincidence index.
	 * With the length you can then find an easy way to determine the key so that you can recover the plaintext.
